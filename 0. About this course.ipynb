    "This course is for you to work through at your own pace. You might blaze through it all and get it out of the way in the Michaelmas term, or you may choose to work through steadily in time for the final ticking session in Lent term. It is loosely linked to some other IA courses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Maths for Natural Sciences_, Michaelmas, Lent, and Easter terms. This present _Scientific Computing_ course is for 75%-CS students, and accompanies _Maths for Natural Sciences_. Natural Sciences students take their own _Scientific Computing_ course, which is targetted at students with very little programming background. The Computer Science version uses Python, while the Natural Sciences version uses MATLAB.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Machine Learning and Real World Data_, Lent term. The MLRD course involves lots of scientific computing and plotting. It expects you to program your work in Java, but some of you might like to sketch out your ideas in Python first.\n",

    "* _Algorithms_, Lent term. Many of the algorithms in _Algorithms_ will be presented in pseudocode that closely resembles Python.\n",

    "* _Object Oriented Programming_, Michaelmas term. Python is an object oriented programming language. We won't cover the OOP features in _Scientific Computing_, but they will be described briefly in _Object Oriented Programming_.
