    "* _Foundations of Computer Science_. The Python language has many functional features, and many of the ideas discussed in _Foundations_ have counterparts in Python. You'll see these links throughout this present course. It's useful to see how different programming languages have their own take on an idea.\n",

Python is an object-oriented language, and every value in Python is an object. _OOP_ will describe some of Python's object-oriented features, and compare them to Java. In this present course we'll use the objects provided by Python and by the other libraries we use, but we won't define any classes ourselves.\n",

Also, Section 3 gives examples of importing data by querying an SQL database, so you can use Python as a sandbox to familiarise yourself with SQL and to visualize query results."
